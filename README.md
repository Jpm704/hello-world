# hello-world

Hello everyone.
My name is Jpm704, and I am pretty new to programming.
I am currently attending a university, but I have a strong desire to learn from experiance developers.
Starting out I have felt somewhat overwhelmed at times, but only because I realize how much is involved.
I am eager to learn, and welcome any advice.
I realize the value of learning from people with experiance, and look forward to the oportunities that may present themselves.
As my contributions to this site grow, I ask that you pull no punches.
I would rather have brutal honesty, that points out where I am lacking, than a pat on the butt, to spare my feelings.
I am setting out on a journey, to become the best developer I possibly can, and I can accept that I will make several novice mistakes.
I intend to use those mistakes to learn.
I look forward to hearing from you.
